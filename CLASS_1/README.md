Hey there!
So, I've signed up for the Machine Learning course and this is what we covered in our first class:
The basics of python which includes the very basic print statement, data-types, for loops and conditional statements,
which are the quintessential stuff we need to know before actually diving into understanding machine learning algorithms.
