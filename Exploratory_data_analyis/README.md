So the datset that I've picked is from sklearn and it's called the iris dataset which includes information regarding the characteristics of a multivariate flower, Iris.
It has columns named sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length and petal_width with all measurements made in cm(centimetre).
The visualisation is done using boxplots and a scatterplot.
Through the plots, we can infer that type 2 iris plants have a higher sepal length and petal length while type 0 has lower sepal as well as petal length.
